# backupninja handler to do incremental backups using
# rsync and hardlinks, based on

#   http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/

# feedback: rhatto at riseup.net | gpl
#
# config file options
# -------------------
#
#   [general]
#   log = rsync log file
#   partition = partition where the backup lives
#   fsck = set to 1 if fsck should run on $partition after the backup is made
#   read_only = set to 1 if $partition is mounted read-only
#   mountpoint = backup partition mountpoint or backup main folder
#   backupdir = folder relative do $mountpoint where the backup should be stored
#   days = number of backup increments (min = 5)
#   lockfile = lockfile to be kept during backup execution
#
#   [source]
#   include = include folder on backup
#   exclude = exclude folder on backup
#   from = local or remote
#   ssh = ssh command line (remote only)
#   rsync = rsync command line
#   exclude_vserver = vserver-name (valid only if vservers = yes on backupninja.conf)
#
#   [services]
#   initscripts = absolute path where scripts are located
#   service = script name to be stoped at the begining of the backup and started at its end
#
# You dont need to manually specify vservers using "include = /vservers".
# They are automatically backed-up if vserver is set to "yes" on your backupninja.conf.
